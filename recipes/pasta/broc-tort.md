# Broccoli Tortellini

## Ingredients

- Large pack tortellini (veal)
- 375ml bottle verjus
- Pine nuts
- 1 punnet Cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1-2 heads Broccoli cut into florets
- 4-6 rashers bacon, diced
- S&p
- EVOO
- Parmesan cheese to serve

## Method

- Toast pine nuts in a dry pan until golden
- Cook pasta, when about 1 min from Al dente add the broccoli to the water, then drain
- Cook bacon until crispy
- Add tomatoes and cook until soft
- Add verjus and cook down until desired consistency. S&P to taste
- Add a little pasta water to the sauce to thin out if needed
- Mix everything, top with pine nuts and parmesan

## Notes

- Adjust the amount of verjus to your taste. I like it a little soup-ier so use the whole bottle, use less for a stickier coating
